## Project Description
This project intends to address questions such as which genre is more popular, which artist's songs have made it to this year's Top 50 tracks, What is the Average Acousticness, Length and Beats per minute for every Genre, what is the relation between two variables (for example: Energy and Loudness), What variables are significant in predicting popularity and so on.

The Dataset that I have worked on has been taken from Kaggle.com.
